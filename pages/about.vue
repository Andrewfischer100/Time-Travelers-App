        <v-card-text>
            <p>Time Travelers is a reciprocal membership network for historical museums and societies throughout the United States. The Missouri History Museum created the program in 1998 so that members of historical institutions could receive exclusive benefits and privileges at museums and historical sites nationwide. These benefits may include free or reduced admission, gift shop discounts, free parking, and much more. The Missouri History Museum will release quarterly lists for museums and their members to help them take advantage of these special offers!</p>
